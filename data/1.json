      "question": "From March 2007 to January 2011, 88 DBE procedures were performed on 66 patients. Indications included evaluation anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD and dilation of strictures. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was used prior to DBE in 43 of the 66 patients prior to DBE evaluation. The mean age was 62 years. Thirty-two patients were female, 15 were African-American; 44 antegrade and 44 retrograde DBEs were performed. The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4±30.0 minutes with a distance of 318.4±152.9 cm reached past the pylorus. The mean time per lower DBE was 100.7±27.3 minutes with 168.9±109.1 cm meters past the ileocecal valve reached. Endoscopic therapy in the form of electrocautery to ablate bleeding sources was performed in 20 patients (30.3%), biopsy in 17 patients (25.8%) and dilation of Crohn's-related small bowel strictures in 4 (6.1%). 43 VCEs with pathology noted were performed prior to DBE, with findings endoscopically confirmed in 32 cases (74.4%). In 3 cases the DBE showed findings not noted on VCE.\n\nUsing the above document as a reference, please review the following question and choose the option you find most appropriate.\nDouble balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting?",

      "question": "Halofantrine is a newly developed antimalarial drug used for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The introduction of this drug has been delayed because of its possible side effects, and due to insufficient studies on adverse reactions in humans. There have been no studies investigating its effect on hearing. Thirty guinea pigs were divided into three groups: a control group, a halofantrine therapeutic dose group and a halofantrine double therapeutic dose group. One cochlea specimen from each animal was stained with haematoxylin and eosin and the other with toluidine blue. No changes were detected in the control group. The halofantrine therapeutic dose group showed loss and distortion of inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells, and loss of spiral ganglia cells. In the halofantrine double therapeutic dose group, the inner and outer hair cells were distorted and there was loss of spiral ganglia cells.\n\nUsing the above document as a reference, please review the following question and choose the option you find most appropriate.\nIs halofantrine ototoxic?",

      "question": "Telephone counseling and tailored print communications have emerged as promising methods for promoting mammography screening. However, there has been little research testing, within the same randomized field trial, of the efficacy of these two methods compared to a high-quality usual care system for enhancing screening. This study addressed the question: Compared to usual care, is tailored telephone counseling more effective than tailored print materials for promoting mammography screening? Three-year randomized field trial. One thousand ninety-nine women aged 50 and older recruited from a health maintenance organization in North Carolina. Women were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) usual care, (2) tailored print communications, and (3) tailored telephone counseling. Adherence to mammography screening based on self-reports obtained during 1995, 1996, and 1997. Compared to usual care alone, telephone counseling promoted a significantly higher proportion of women having mammograms on schedule (71% vs 61%) than did tailored print (67% vs 61%) but only after the first year of intervention (during 1996). Furthermore, compared to usual care, telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting being on schedule with screening during 1996 and 1997 among women who were off-schedule during the previous year.\n\nUsing the above document as a reference, please review the following question and choose the option you find most appropriate.\nCan tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?",
